## Docker setup

### DOCKER ESSENTIAL VOCAB

    Image: This is essentially the “installation” of something that you want to run using Docker. An image contains all the data necessary to run containers. Images are hierarchical and a new image that shares information with an older one will not reproduce this information and instead just re-use it (i.e. if you have two Ubuntu based images with different software installed, they will both refer to the same base Ubuntu image rather than copy its contents). This is what people mean when they say that Docker’s filesystem is layered.

    Container: An instance of a particular image. This is equivalent to running, say Firefox, twice. In that scenario Firefox is installed once but can be launched multiple times and each instance refers back to the same installation. when a container is running, it can’t make any changes to the underlying image (images are read only!) but gets assigned a new filesystem for storage of new information. Images may be ephemeral (that is they are removed once you stop them and any new data is destroyed), or persistent (containers are kept either in an on or off state until they are explicitly removed). Note that it is possible to mount external volumes onto the containers and all changes made to the host filesystem this way are persistent!

    Dockerfile: Simple configuration file that defines how your container is built. You can start FROM a base container, RUN a series of shell commands, set up ENVironment variables, ADD or COPY things from the host filesystem, specify what command runs when your container is started, and more! These files can start from scratch or from an existing image. Popular Linux distribution provide various images in an official capacity on …

### Tutorial Steps

first create a docker image called "ros-demo"

`docker build -t ros-demo . `

now you can run a container using the ros-demo 
`docker-compose run --rm ros-demo`

Now you are inside your running docker container. 
`cd /tutorial`

Do all the work inside your /tutorial folder. This is the only folder linked to your host computer.
